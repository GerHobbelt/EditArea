/*
A not-so-entirely-dummy file for loading EditArea through the Combiner instead of using the edit_area_full[_with_plugins].js files directly:
the latter are pre-flattened, minified versions of the actual sources and are a bother when you're debugging edit_are itself; CompactCMS can
handle this flattening/minifying job quite well at run-time through our use of the Combiner (combine.inc.php).
